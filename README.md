# Machine-Learning-Projects

In this project, we evaluate the performance and complexity of the logistic regression and Naive Bayes on four datasets including Ionosphere, Adult, Iris, and Wine. 
Overall, Logistic regression shows superiority over Naive Bayes on large size datasets. However, both classifiers achieve the same performance on Adult and Iris datasets. We find that the performance of a classifier depends on the nature and characteristics of the dataset. Logistic regression accuracy increases as the number of iterations increases. We also find that the learning time of Logistic regression is longer compared to Naive Bayes. Additionally, we conclude that as the size of training instances increases the model performance increases.
